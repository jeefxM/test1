<h1>ThirdMerch</h1>
<p>ThirdMerch is a cutting-edge web3 e-commerce platform that harnesses the power of NFTs and other web3 technologies to enhance the customer experience and build stronger relationships between users and brands. Our platform is built on top of Shopify's tools and Thirdweb's web3 logic, with a Next.js frontend and Three.js for 3D models.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Exclusive Content and Discounts</strong> - Users can claim NFTs that grant them exclusive access to content and discounts on products. Our authentication system ensures that only NFT holders can access the exclusive benefits, while non-NFT holders can still purchase regular products.</li>
  <li><strong>Personalized Checkout</strong> - If users provide their information, it will be displayed on the checkout page for a more personalized experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Creator NFTs</strong> - In the future, we plan to implement Creator NFTs that allow creators to mint their own ERC1155 edition-drop collections and offer benefits to their NFT holders. This will generate revenue for the brands and increase engagement with customers.</li>
  <li><strong>Advertisement NFTs</strong> - We will also introduce Advertisement NFTs that enable creators to promote their brands on various social media platforms.</li>
  <li><strong>Brand Collaborations</strong> - Finally, we aim to support brand collaborations that allow multiple brands to deploy a joint ERC1155 collection and provide benefits to their NFT holders.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges Overcome</h2>
<p>One of the main challenges we faced while building ThirdMerch was integrating the web3 logic with Shopify's tools, such as discounts and token gates. However, by leveraging Thirdweb's tools and our team's strong development skills, we were able to overcome this challenge and create a seamless integration between the two technologies.</p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>In the future, we plan to implement additional features, such as improved authentication and avatar generation, as well as further optimizations for speed and performance. We are also open to feedback and suggestions from the community to ensure that ThirdMerch remains at the forefront of web3 e-commerce innovation.</p>
